Design System Reference (LLM-readable)

UI primitives:
- components/ui/*
- Radix-based controls with Tailwind styling

Key guidance:
1. Keep semantics and keyboard behavior intact when composing wrappers.
2. Require labels for icon-only controls.
3. Use consistent variant and sizing patterns in workflow components.
4. Prefer reusable components over one-off inline markup for repeated patterns.
