# PRODUCT_SENSE

## Product Positioning

A research-grade writing studio for controlled long-form continuation, optimized for continuity and phase-level observability.

## Core User Jobs

1. Continue an existing novel without style collapse.
2. Control chapter pacing and narrative escalation.
3. Keep character/world consistency over long context windows.
4. Inspect and rerun specific phases instead of regenerating everything.

## Value Drivers

- Structured pipeline with inspectable outputs.
- Lorebook and consistency systems as quality scaffolding.
- Local-first workflow with low operation overhead.

## Product Risks

- Token and cost blowups for long contexts.
- Over-constrained prompts reducing narrative creativity.
- Weak production auth posture if deployed publicly.
