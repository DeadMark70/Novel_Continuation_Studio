# PLANS

## Planning System

- Active work: `docs/exec-plans/active/`
- Completed work: `docs/exec-plans/completed/`
- Debt ledger: `docs/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`

## Plan Template

Every plan should define:

1. Objective
2. Scope
3. Work items
4. Risks
5. Success metrics
6. Exit criteria

## Change Policy

- Move completed plan files to `completed/`.
- Keep historical plan docs immutable except factual corrections.
