# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity: "Noir Industrial Command Center"
The application should feel like a high-precision instrument for creative exploration—atmospheric, moody, yet undeniably clinical and controlled.

### 1. Color Palette
-   **Primary Background:** Deep Black (`#0a0a0a`) / Dark Charcoal (`#121212`).
-   **Secondary Surfaces:** Matte Charcoal (`#1a1a1a`) for panels and modular sections.
-   **Accents:** High-vibrancy "Signal" colors.
    -   *Action/Success:* Electric Cyan or Neon Blue.
    -   *Warning/Error:* Sharp Crimson.
    -   *Processing/Status:* Amber or White.
-   **Contrast:** High contrast between text and background to ensure readability in dark environments.

### 2. Typography
-   **UI & Headings:** A clean, high-contrast Sans-Serif (e.g., *Geist*, *Inter*, or *Roboto Mono* for a slightly technical edge).
-   **Logs & Metadata:** Monospaced font (e.g., *JetBrains Mono*) for the "Command Center" feel, especially in streaming logs.
-   **Content (The Novel):** A highly readable, slightly wider sans-serif or a very modern serif to differentiate "tooling" from "creation."

### 3. Layout & Composition
-   **Command Center Structure:** Modular, grid-based layout. Use sharp edges or minimal border-radius (max 4px) to maintain a "precise instrument" feel.
-   **Workflow Stepper:** A prominent, persistent progress indicator that feels like a mission control dashboard.
-   **Information Density:** Balanced. Not as cluttered as SillyTavern, but provides immediate access to status logs, word counts, and generation parameters.

### 4. Interaction & Motion
-   **Status Visibility:** Highly visible status indicators. Use "Terminal-like" logs for background processes (e.g., analyzing story, generating chapters) to provide feedback.
-   **Precision Controls:** Use slider increments, toggle switches, and discrete buttons that feel tactile and responsive.
-   **Micro-interactions:** Subtle "scan-line" effects or flickering cursors during streaming generation to enhance the atmospheric "Noir" feel.
-   **Transitions:** Quick, snap-to-place transitions rather than slow, bouncy animations to emphasize clinical efficiency.

### 5. Tone & Voice
-   **Interface Copy:** Direct, functional, and professional. Avoid "fluff" or overly friendly AI personas. 
-   **Atmosphere:** Dark, focused, and immersive. The UI should "recede" into the darkness, leaving only the controls and the growing story illuminated.
